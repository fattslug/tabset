# Tabset

Tabset is a chrome extension that lets you open up a set of tabs at the click of a button.
I use this to restore my tab session after I close my browser.
Tabset lets you configure grouped tabs and pinned tabs as well.

## Set Up

To use this extension, rename the file called `config.template.js` in your project root to be `config.js`.
Fill out the template as you see fit.

## Install

1. Clone this repo locally
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner of the screen
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Open up the folder you cloned the repo into, then click "Open"
6. Done
